Rest jobs will be abandoned.\r\n    Submited job will not be affected. Kill the process if you will.\r\n\r\n\r\n## History of BatchRun\r\n\r\nThis is a project in GoogleCode, if you are interested in the old code, you can find it [here](https://code.google.com/p/batchrun/).\r\n\r\nIn the first edtion of this project, I use pp to control processes. In this lastest version, pp is not used anymore. Standard library is quite enough for this project.\r\n\r\nI am trying to prettify the output by adding Pid in front of the output, but I cannot work it out. If anyone can improve this, I will be very appreciated. \r\n\r\nAnother main drawback of this project is that the job list cannot be modified after the list is submitted. Since this project is not meant to be a fullsize task balance system, this feature may not be coded in near future. If anyone interested improve this, I will be very appreciated, too.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
